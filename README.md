# Credit-card-fraud-Detection-Machine-learning
 It's Credit Card Fraud Detection System Using Machine learning,Here I use Two ML algorithom to find out which one is better perform
 and identify the fraud 
 
 It is unsupervised learning. In this case, the suspicious transactions are not defined, 
hence there are no labels of "fraud" and "not fraud". The model tries to identify outliers by looking at anomalous transactions and flags them as 'fraud'
